          <h3 class="faq-question">What does my 4aGoodCause payment page include?</h3>
          <div class="body body-faq-answer">
            <p>A 4aGoodCause payment page is a set of customized, secure online forms that help you take a payment online. Each "page" is a secure, user-friendly checkout process for a single payment type. For example, you might have one payment page that is for online donations, one for membership payment and one for event registration. Unless noted otherwise, each of our e-commerce modules counts as one payment page. Each page is hosted on our server and links from your organization's web site.</p>
