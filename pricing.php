      <h2 class="section-title-center">Common Questions</h2>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-1-2">
          <h4>What is "Interchange"?</h4>
          <p>For every credit/debit card that exists, there is a pre-set associated rate that the merchant service provider pays to the issuing bank. This rate is known as the Interchange rate. Interchange-plus or cost-plus pricing works by adding a constant, flat margin on top of the interchange rate. It's widely considered the fairest model in the industry.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-1-2">
          <h4>What is a merchant account and payment gateway?</h4>
          <p>A merchant account and payment gateway are services that work together to allow you to process credit card transactions over the Internet. Our payment pages connect to these accounts to get you paid. We'll set you up with a merchant account from Dharma Merchant Services, the #1 rated provider for nonprofits.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-1-2">
          <h4>How does Interchange-plus pricing save me money?</h4>
          <p>There are many card types that are much less expensive to accept, especially for nonprofits. For example, certain debit cards can be processed at interchange rates of less than 0.4%. Those savings are passed through to your nonprofit. Nonprofits that switch to Interchange-plus pricing regularly save 10-40% on their credit card processing, sometimes more.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-1-2">
          <h4>Can we use our existing merchant account or payment gateway provider with 4aGoodCause?</h4>
          <p>While we believe our merchant account partner offers the best rates and service available, if you want to use our service with your own merchant account provider we can typically still work with you. Contact us for compatibility and pricing details.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-1-2">
          <h4>Are there any design fees or fees for new pages?</h4>
          <p>No, there are no setup or design fees on any of our plans. In addition there are no fees when you need additional payment pages or changes to your existing pages.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-1-2">
          <h4>Do you require a minimum time commitment?</h4>
          <p>No. Our contract is month-to-month. You also benefit from fantastic terms from our merchant account partner. Dharma Merchant Services has no early termination fees, no annual fees, no monthly minimums, no application fees, and no added PCI compliance fees.</p>
